"Noughts and Crosses," also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid.

### Game Status

The game status occupies the space between the bottom of the grid and the button, serving as a crucial information hub for players. From indicating the initial turn to providing real-time updates on the game's outcome, this feature plays a pivotal role in enhancing the overall gaming experience.

At the start, the status is set to "Player X, your turn," establishing the turn sequence, with Player X taking the first move. As the game progresses, the status dynamically updates to reflect the current player's turn, eliminating any confusion and allowing users to seamlessly follow the gameplay.

Furthermore, the game status serves as an instant messenger of victory or draw. When a player clinches a win or when the game concludes in a draw, this information is promptly communicated through the status, providing a clear and concise summary of the result.

This feature adds substantial value by keeping players informed, eliminating guesswork regarding the active turn, and promptly delivering the game's outcome. In doing so, it significantly contributes to a more enjoyable and carefree gaming experience, allowing players to focus on the strategic aspects of the game without the distraction of uncertainty.


# Features left to implement

Future enhancements will include the integration of an algorithm, enabling players to engage in strategic battles against the computer. The introduction of difficulty levels—easy, medium, and hard—will empower players to tailor the gaming experience to their skill level, introducing a new layer of dynamic fun.

Additionally, a scoreboard feature is on the horizon, backed by a robust database system. This advancement will capture and record players' scores, injecting a competitive element into the game. Not only will users be able to test their strategic prowess against varying computer difficulty levels, but they can also track their progress and compete with others, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

# Testing
My testing phase commenced with multiple rounds of gameplay to ensure the accuracy of the game status. This iterative approach facilitated the examination of various game features, including the grid functionality and the restart button. Throughout eight test runs, I meticulously verified that the status bar appropriately recognized both draw and win outcomes, and the results were consistent with expectations. The grid performed seamlessly during the entire testing process, and the restart button demonstrated its functionality as intended.


Below are the results from Lighthouse the results of the report where the same on desktop and mobile devices.
